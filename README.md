#Welcome to the Glassdoor Review Summarizer. 

My objective for this project was to help job hunters gain a better understanding of the companies that they are applying. 

I built a web crawler utilizing import.io to scrape Glassdoor.com employee reviews for about 1,000 companies. 

My model is based on a Tf-Idf Vectorizer 

Through the course of the project, I learned a lot about web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python Flask.
